  ## Motivation
  This project is made to simplify client or employee non-sensitive search info.  

  ## Installation
  No installation needed.  Click *[here](https://jmeggles.github.io/19_User_Directory/)* to use the deployed app.

  ## How_to_use
  Once the React application is opened, sort users by first or last name to view that person's information. <br>
  *(Disclaimer: This uses a random generator with fake user information as templates to show app functionality.)*  

  ## Benefit
  An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about employees or clients sorted or filtered by selected column such as first and last names.
