  ## Motivation
  Why was this project started.

  ## Installation
  No installation needed.  Click *[here](https://jmeggles.github.io/19_User_Directory/)* to use the deployed app.

  ## How_to_use
  Once the React application is opened, sort users by first or last name to view that person's information. *(Disclaimer: This uses a random generator with fake names, numbers, and other information as templates to show app functionality.)*  

  ## Benefit
  An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees sorted/filtered by selected column such as first and last names.
